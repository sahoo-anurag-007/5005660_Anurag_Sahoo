Exercise 6: Implementing the Proxy Pattern

The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate object that controls access to the real object. In this exercise, you'll create an image viewer application that loads images from a remote server. The goal is to provide a way to control access to the real image object, allowing for lazy initialization and caching. This pattern is useful when you need to control access to an object, such as for security or performance reasons.
