Exercise 2: Implementing the Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. In this exercise, you'll create a DocumentFactory class that can create different types of documents (e.g., Word, PDF, Excel). The goal is to decouple the creation of objects from their specific implementation, allowing for more flexibility and extensibility in your code. This pattern is useful when you need to create objects that share a common base class or interface, but have different implementations.
